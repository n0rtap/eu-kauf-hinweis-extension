# EU Purchase Reminder 🇪🇺

A Chrome extension that gently reminds you to consider European alternatives when visiting US tech giants and online shops.

## Why?

Supporting local businesses matters. This extension gives you a nudge when you're about to shop on Amazon, use Google services, or browse other non-EU platforms — helping you make a conscious choice to support European alternatives when possible.

## Features

- **Friendly reminder overlay** when visiting US/non-EU websites
- **Direct links to EU alternatives** via [european-alternatives.eu](https://european-alternatives.eu)
- **Custom alternatives** — set your own preferred EU shops (e.g., Amazon → Kaufland)
- **100+ pre-configured domains** including Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and more
- **Session-based dismissal** — won't nag you repeatedly on the same site
- **Fully customizable** — add/remove domains as you like

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
4. Click **Load unpacked**
5. Select the extension folder

## Usage

Once installed, the extension will show a reminder when you visit sites like:
- amazon.com/de/fr/etc.
- google.com, gmail.com, youtube.com
- facebook.com, instagram.com, whatsapp.com
- github.com, slack.com, zoom.us
- and many more...

You can:
- **"I know, I know..."** — dismiss and continue to the site
- **"Take me to alternative"** — go to an EU alternative

## Customization

Click the extension icon or go to the options page to:
- Add or remove domains from the watch list
- Set your own custom alternatives (e.g., `amazon.de → kaufland.de`)
- Import a list of domains from a file

## Privacy

This extension:
- Does **not** collect any data
- Does **not** make any external requests (except when you click an alternative link)
- Stores settings locally in your browser

They've done an amazing job curating a database of European alternatives to US tech products. This extension relies on their work to suggest alternatives. If you find this useful, check out their site and support their mission!
